                <h6>Brief History</h6>
                <p>This organisation is founded by students and is still a proposal.</p>

            <div class="info_box">
                <h5>Current Status?</h5>
                <p>We are still developing and the idea is still under proposal. Therefore, we would like to note that: <strong>"We are not associated with the official MUIDS"</strong> yet. This is simply a testing place for our proposal. Hence, we would like to politely ask the viewer not to share this page under the name of the school by any means.
